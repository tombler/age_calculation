# Age Calculation

## About

This is a simple project to determine a user's exact age using Javascript. The user enters his/her birthday (Month, Day, Year) and the program outputs the user's current age to the second. It also outputs a random nickname based on the user's birthday using an array of adjectives and nouns.

## Installation

* Run `git clone https://github.com/tombler/age_calculation.git` from your CLI.
* `cd age_calcuation` and serve with your local host from the project directory.
